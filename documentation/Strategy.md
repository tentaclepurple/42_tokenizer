# 42 Token (TTT) - Strategic Documentation

## Overview

The 42 Token (TTT) is a custom ERC20 token designed to serve as an internal currency within the 42 school ecosystem. This token facilitates transactions in campus stores worldwide and incentivizes student achievement through a reward system.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of the 42 Token are:

1. To provide a unified currency for all 42 campuses globally.
2. To incentivize and reward student performance and engagement.
3. To create a micro-economy within the 42 ecosystem.

## Token Distribution

### Initial Distribution

- An initial supply of tokens is minted and distributed to the 42 administration.
- The exact amount of initial supply is determined based on the projected needs of the ecosystem.

### Ongoing Distribution

- Tokens are distributed to students by staff members as rewards for achieving specific objectives, such as:
  - Completing projects
  - Participating in events
  - Contributing to the community
  - Reaching certain milestones in the curriculum

## Token Utility

1. **Campus Store Purchases**: Students can use TTT to buy merchandise, equipment, or services at any 42 campus store worldwide.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Transfers**: Students can transfer tokens among themselves, enabling a dynamic internal economy.

3. **Special Event Access**: Certain events or activities may require token payment for participation.

## Deflationary Mechanism

To maintain and potentially increase the value of TTT over time, a deflationary mechanism is implemented:

1. **Periodic Burns**: The administration can initiate token burns at regular intervals, reducing the total supply.

2. **Purchase Burns**: When students make purchases at campus stores, a portion of the spent tokens may be burned.

3. **Controlled Burn Process**: 
   - Burn requests are created by the contract owner.
   - Both the owner and a designated second signer must approve each burn request.
   - This dual-approval system ensures transparency and prevents unauthorized token destruction.

### Benefits of Deflation

1. **Scarcity**: As the total supply decreases, each remaining token potentially becomes more valuable.

2. **Incentive for Holding**: The deflationary nature encourages students to hold tokens, anticipating future value increase.

3. **Balanced Economy**: Regular burns help balance token distribution and prevent oversaturation of the ecosystem.

## Security Measures

- The smart contract includes ownership controls to ensure only authorized personnel can mint or burn tokens.
- A dual-signature system is implemented for burn requests, adding an extra layer of security.

## Future Considerations

- Integration with a wider range of 42 activities and services.
- Potential for external partnerships to expand token utility beyond the 42 ecosystem.
- Regular review and adjustment of distribution and burn rates to maintain a healthy token economy.

## Conclusion

The 42 Token (TTT) is designed to create a vibrant, self-sustaining economy within the 42 school network. By combining utility, incentives, and deflationary mechanisms, TTT aims to provide lasting value to students while fostering engagement and achievement in the 42 community.
